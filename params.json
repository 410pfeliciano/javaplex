As of spring 2014, we have moved to this present page at GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n* March, 2016: [Version 4.2.5](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/releases/) is released\r\n* Jan, 2016: Version 4.2.4 released\r\n* July, 2015: Version 4.2.3 released\r\n* March, 2015: Version 4.2.2 released\r\n* July, 2014: Version 4.2.1 released\r\n* April, 2014: Google Code hosting abandoned\r\n* May, 2012: Version 4.1.0 released\r\n* For frequently asked questions regarding `JavaPlex` and troubleshooting information, consult the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/wiki/Troubleshooting) page.\r\n",
